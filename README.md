## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/languel/cloudywindow.git
   cd cloudywindow
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the app:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Configuration

- Environment and build settings: see `docs/ENV.md` for icon generation via `.env` and notes on runtime transparency/safety toggles.
- Scripts:
  - `npm start` ‚Äî run the app in development.
  - `npm run icon` ‚Äî generate a macOS icon from an emoji (uses `.env`, macOS only).
  - `npm run build` ‚Äî build distributables via electron-builder (invokes icon generation on macOS).
  - `npm run clean` ‚Äî remove ignored files (dangerous; review with `npm run clean:dry`).

## Usage
- Use the navigation bar to enter URLs or open files.
 - Drag and drop files, folders, or URLs anywhere on the window to open them. A "Drop file or URL" overlay appears while dragging.
   - Images/PDFs: open directly; document viewer backdrops are forced transparent.
   - HTML files: self‚Äëcontained HTML opens directly. If it references local assets, prefer dropping the entire folder.
   - Folders: resolves to `index.html` (or first `.html`) and runs locally via `file://`.
   - Note: Some pages can swallow drag events; if drop doesn't trigger, use the shortcuts below.
- Links that open in a new tab/window (`target=_blank`) are intercepted and opened as a new CloudyWindow with the same frameless, transparent style. New windows are managed in the Window menu.
- Per‚Äësite CSS:
  - Developer ‚Üí Site CSS ‚Üí Edit In‚ÄëApp‚Ä¶ opens a JSON editor backed by `site-css.json` in your user data folder.
  - Click ‚ÄúStart Picker‚Äù then:
    - üìÑ `P` page/root transparent ‚Ä¢ ü´• `T` transparent ‚Ä¢ üôà `H` hide ‚Ä¢ ‚Ü©Ô∏è `Z` undo ‚Ä¢ ‚ôªÔ∏è `R` reset site rules (keeps built‚Äëin starter rules) ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ `Enter` done ‚Ä¢ ‚úñÔ∏è `Esc` cancel
  - Save to persist. Rules apply on the next navigation for that site.
- Frameless resize: drag edges/corners (invisible handles) to resize.
- Drag region: a 24px invisible bar at the top allows window dragging when UI is hidden.
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Cmd+Opt+O` - Open file
  - `Opt+Shift+O` - Open folder (loads `index.html` if present)
  - `Cmd+Opt+U` - Toggle UI visibility
  - `Cmd+Opt+L` - Go to URL bar
  - `Cmd+Opt+R` - Reload content (webview)
  - `Opt+Shift+R` - Reload app window
  - `Cmd+Opt+B` - Flash border (quick orientation)
  - `Cmd+W` - Close window
  - `Cmd+Plus/Minus/0` - Zoom in/out/reset
  - Background opacity: `Opt+Shift+0/5/1`, step `Opt+Shift+[ / ]`
  - Overall (content) opacity: `Cmd+Opt+0/5/1`, step `Cmd+Opt+[ / ]`
  - Apply transparency CSS (manual): `Cmd+Opt+T`
  - `Opt+Shift+T` - Toggle Always‚Äëon‚ÄëTop (this window)
  - `Opt+Shift+M` - Toggle Click‚Äëthrough mode (this window; global shortcut also available for recovery)
  - `Cmd+Opt+P` - Start DOM/CSS Picker (this window)
  - `Shift+F9` - Bottom half
  - `Shift+F12` - Bottom‚Äëright 1/16 size (1/4√ó1/4)
  - `Shift+F11` - Centered overscan (push site UI offscreen)

Transparency safety toggles (in app):
- View ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Transparent or Near Transparent window background
- View ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Canvas Safe Mode (disable Accelerated 2D)
- View ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Pre‚ÄëDraw Hard Flush

## Packaging
This repository uses electron-builder as the canonical packager and outputs artifacts into `dist/` by default.

To build distributable packages (macOS example):
```sh
npm run build
```

Notes:
- Local builds will skip code signing unless you have a Developer ID certificate configured. Signed builds are required for public distribution on macOS.

## Demos
The app loads `default-cloud.html` by default. There are additional local demos you can open with the URL input or by dropping files into the window:

- `default-cloud.html` - transparent desktop companion demo (cloud with eyes + doodling)
- `default-minimal.html` - minimal transparent page with emoji

Example to open the minimal default from the URL bar:
```
file://<path-to-repo>/default-minimal.html
```

## Notes
- Webview is used for content: drag & drop and per‚Äësite CSS injection are supported.
- Popup handling: The webview has `allowpopups`, but the app intercepts all `window.open`/`_blank` requests and routes them to managed CloudyWindows (native titlebar is never shown).
- Site CSS store: Rules live at Electron `userData/site-css.json` (per-user, survives updates). Use the in-app editor or open externally.
- PDFs: Opening PDFs directly in a webview depends on platform support; alternatively open in the system browser.
- Drag & Drop: Some pages may intercept drops; use `Cmd+Opt+O` / `Opt+Shift+O` if needed.
 - DnD with folders: On some OS paths aren‚Äôt exposed from the drag source; CloudyWindow imports the folder to a temp location and opens its `index.html` automatically (no server required).
 - Single HTML vs. folder: Dropping a single HTML file without a real path may render via a blob URL (relative assets won‚Äôt load). Drop the folder or use Open Folder‚Ä¶ for sketches with assets.
 - Document viewer transparency: Built‚Äëin viewers for file:/blob:/data: URLs have their backdrops cleared to transparent.
 - Transparency stability: For fully transparent windows (0% alpha) GPU canvas pages may show afterimages. The default is 1% alpha; when at 0% the app performs short hard flushes. See `docs/DEVLOG.md` for details.

## Build Icon (macOS)
- To embed a macOS app icon generated from the üå¶Ô∏è emoji:
  - `npm run icon` (creates `build/icon.icns`), then `npm run build`.
  - If icon creation fails in CI/headless, the build continues with the default Electron icon.

## Docs
- Product requirements and plan: `docs/PRD.md`
- Dev log of solutions and challenges: `docs/DEVLOG.md` (includes transparency/afterimage experiments)
 - Environment and build settings: `docs/ENV.md`
 - Zap CSS + per-site CSS design/UX: `docs/ZAPCSS.md`

## macOS Unsigned Builds (Gatekeeper)
If you distribute an unsigned build to students, macOS may block it. Options:

- Easiest: Right-click the app, choose `Open`, then confirm. This whitelists once.
- Remove quarantine attribute (after moving the app to `/Applications`):
  ```sh
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/CloudyWindow.app"
  ```
- If Gatekeeper still intercepts, ad‚Äëhoc sign locally:
  ```sh
  sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - "/Applications/CloudyWindow.app"
  ```

Notes:
- Only run these commands for software you trust.
- After updates, you may need to repeat the `xattr` step.
